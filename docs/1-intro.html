<!-- ******************* INTRODUCTION ******************** -->
<h2><u>1. Introduction</u></h2>
Thank you for choosing the often regarded number one Remote Method Invocation package for Python!
<p>
Pyro is an acronym for PYthon Remote Objects. 
It is an advanced and powerful Distributed Object Technology system written entirely in Python,
	that is designed to be very easy to use. It resembles Java's Remote Method
Invocation (<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/index.html">RMI</a>).
It has less similarity to <a href="http://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a> - which
is a system and language independent Distributed Object Technology and
has much more to offer than Pyro or RMI. But Pyro is <strong>small</strong>, <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>free</strong>!
For another overview of what Pyro is, see the Pyro page online 
(<a href="http://pyro.sourceforge.net/">http://pyro.sourceforge.net/</a>). You can also download the package from there.

<p><strong>Security Warning</strong>
<br>
<em>In the Security chapter is an <a href="9-security.html">important security warning</a> that you absolutely must read!</em>
<p><strong>To get an idea of how Pyro works, here is a scenario:</strong>
<ol>
<li>You write a module '<code>test</code>' containing a class '<code>testclass</code>', which will be accessed remotely.</li>
<li>The server creates one or more instances of the '<code>testclass</code>', and registers them with the Pyro Name Server.</li>
<li>The client queries the Name Server for the location of those objects. It gets a Pyro URI (Universal Resource Identifier) for them.</li>
<li>The client creates proxies for the remote objects. </li>
<li>Because the proxy mimics the real '<code>testclass</code>', the client can now invoke methods on the remote objects. The proxy will forward the method invocations and return the results, just as if it was the remote object itself.
Not a single line of network communication code has been written.
</ol>
This looks like a big oversimplification, but it isn't!
<p>To dive directly into the code, have a look at the various Pyro examples in the <code>examples</code> directory (read the <code>Readme.txt</code>). There is much to learn there.
The easiest example to start with is the &quot;simple&quot; example, it shows how a normal python object is made into a Pyro object and accessed remotely from the client.
<p><strong>Required Software:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This version of Pyro needs at least Python 2.3. However, it is strongly recommended
to use the latest Python version available (at the time of writing 2.4).
You may be able to run it on older Python versions (2.1 or 2.2) but it has
not been tested on those ancient versions. If it doesn't work, try a recent Python
first before reporting a problem. Thank you.
<li>There is some compatibility with Jython, but no servers are possible, and problems may occur due to Jython bugs.
<li>Because basic Pyro does not depend on any third party libraries or extension modules, it runs wherever Python is available, however, the command line
utility scripts are designed for Windows(NT) and Unix sh. You might 
experience problems trying to run them on other systems.
<li>The <code>xnsc</code> tool requires the Tkinter Python extension module, with Tcl/Tk installed.
<li>The <code>wxnsc</code> tool requires the WxPython extension module with WxWindows.

I want to thank everybody on the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyro-core">Pyro mailing list</a>,
your participation is of great value. And to everybody who contacted me about Pyro, for positive
remarks, comments, or with problems (it all helps to improve Pyro): Thank You!
<p>
If you appreciate my efforts and would like to express your appreciation by a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=18837">cash donation</a>,
that is gladly accepted. But because I'm doing Pyro for fun, I've decided to support the PSF by making all donations trough SourceForge 
go to the <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>.
